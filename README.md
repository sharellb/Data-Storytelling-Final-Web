# Surfing My Memory Web
**an interactive musical archive of my memories of growing up on the world wide web.**
built for Data Storytelling for Memory Making and Social Resilience taught by John Henry Thompson and Shindy Johnson at ITP Fall 2024

### Description
**Surfing My Memory Web** is an interactive musical archive of my memories of the internet. Movement of the body is detected by a web camera and used to navigate visually through different technology aesthetic sketches I've collaged together using personal media I've recorded across devices, applications, and social media sites.
