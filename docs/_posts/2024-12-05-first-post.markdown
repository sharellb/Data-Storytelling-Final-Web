# Notes for Working on Surfing My Web and Creating a Blog and Initial Page

- Goal is to have a page with an initial look and test of the data running to take a video of and submit to the projects database in preparation for the ITP show and final class presentation for DataStorytelling class

## Process

- Set up Jekyll
- Update Ruby
- Install chruby using Homebrew (already installed)
- Install chruby and update shell (iTerm), needed to update in bash_profile (used vim)
- Closed and reopened iTerm checked chruby
- Used chruby to install latest ruby version (ruby-3.3.5?)
- Check that the latest ruby version loaded using ruby -v
- Install Jekyll
- Set up Jekyll in docs folder
- Update gitignore
- Update text of first post
- Run jekyll locally

## TODO

- Push changes up to github
- Configure settings to publish blog
- Test publishing blog
- Now test out publishing the page itself

## Questions

- What's origin of the markdown language?
